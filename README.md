# Open git repos in browser directly from Sublime Text

This lightweight plugin was created as I often need to point out specific spots in repos to other people, bookmark them for future use for myself etc. Instead of opening repo in browser and browsing to necessary file/line manually GitUrl plugin allows to do it directly from Sublime Text automatically.

Supports Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab repos.
